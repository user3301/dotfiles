Fully Reproducible dotfiles config

"Dotfiles managed by Nix: because spending 40 hours to save 4 minutes is a lifestyle. Fully reproducible - I've tested it on my Windows gaming rig (WSL2), my wife's MacBook Air, and my own laptop (I use Arch BTW). If it works there, it'll work anywhere."

FAQ

Q: Why Nix?
