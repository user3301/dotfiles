# Ignore unencrypted secrets files
secrets.yaml

# Only commit encrypted files
# Encrypted files will have sops metadata and be safe to commit

# Defense in Depth
#
#  Even though the file is encrypted, keeping it in .gitignore provides an important safety layer:
#
#  1. Prevents accidental commits of unencrypted secrets: If you or someone else temporarily decrypts the file to edit it manually and forgets to re-encrypt it, the .gitignore will prevent the unencrypted version from being committed.
#  2. Requires explicit intent: With the file in .gitignore, you must use git add -f secrets/secrets.yaml to commit changes. This forces you to be intentional about committing the encrypted file.
#  3. Workflow safety: This pattern ensures you only commit the file when you explicitly mean to, and ideally after verifying it's properly encrypted.
